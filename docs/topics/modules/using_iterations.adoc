= Using an iteration

Use iterations to prioritize work items slated for execution in the development cycle.

. After you <<creating_a_new_iteration,create an iteration>> and <<associating_work_items_with_an_iteration-user-guide_iterations,associate work items>> to the iteration, select the iteration to display the associated work items.
+
NOTE: Only execution work item types such as *Feature*, *Task* and *Bug* are displayed in the iteration view. You can use the tree view to see the parent *Scenarios* or *Experiences* linked to the work items in the iteration.

. You can use the *Add Work Item* pane to further <<creating_a_new_work_item,add new work items>> to the iteration.
. To modify the iteration click the options (image:kabob.png[title="Options"]) icon next to the iteration and use:
* *Edit _iteration name_* to see the *Update Iteration* screen and change the iteration name, description, start or end dates, or to forcibly activate it.
* *Close* to end your iteration. Note that this option is available only if the iteration is active.
* *Create child* to create a child iteration for the target iteration.
